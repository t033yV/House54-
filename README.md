Design Explanation
Black and White Theme: The black background (#000) with white text (#fff) creates a stark, exclusive feel.

Typography: Large, uppercase h1 with letter spacing and a subtle glow (text-shadow) gives it a futuristic edge. The italicized “highlight” text adds sophistication.

Layout: Centered content with a full-screen height (100vh) and a vertical gradient line in the background for depth.

Interactivity: The “Contact Us” button has a hover effect that inverts colors, keeping it sleek yet engaging.

Responsive: Adjusts font sizes for smaller screens without losing impact.
